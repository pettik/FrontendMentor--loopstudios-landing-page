# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios Landing Page

![Design preview for the Loopstudios landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

My challenge was to build out the **Loopstudios Landing Page** and make it as close to the provided design as possible. I was free to use any tools I liked to complete the challenge, making it a great opportunity to improve my layout and responsive design skills.

I ensured that my users could:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the mobile menu with a functional toggle (optional JavaScript)

## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was a great opportunity for me to practice **CSS Grid, Flexbox, and responsive design techniques**. I focused on structuring my HTML semantically and styling it with pure CSS without relying on a framework.
